📂 Project Structure
- iris_analysis.py – Main Python script containing:
  - Data loading (using seaborn's built-in Iris dataset)
  - Data cleaning (handling missing values)
  - Basic statistics and grouping
  - Data visualization (line chart, bar chart, histogram, scatter plot)
🛠️ Requirements
Make sure you have Python 3 installed. Then install dependencies using:

pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn
▶️ How to Run
